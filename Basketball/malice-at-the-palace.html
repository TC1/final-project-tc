				<h1>MALICE AT THE PALACE </h1>
				<h2>NOVEMBER 19, 2004. </h2>
				<p>The Pacersâ€“Pistons brawl (colloquially known as the Malice at the Palace) was an altercation that occurred in a National Basketball Association game between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Associated Press called it &quot;the most infamous brawl in NBA history.&quot;<br>
					With less than a minute left in the game, a fight broke out between players on the court. After the fight was broken up, a drink was thrown from the stands at then Pacers player Ron Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest then entered the crowd and sparked a massive brawl between players and fans.<br>
					The repercussions led to nine players being suspended without pay for a total of 146 games, which led to $11 million in salary being lost by the players. Five players were also charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security presence between players and fans, and to limit the sale of alcohol. </p>

				<p>This will go down as the greatest (worst) fight in NBA history due to sheer size. Also note that the game was essentially over, there was less than a minute to play and the Pistons were up by 13. Things went south immediatly after that one foul. Ron Artest changed his name to Metta World Peace and was fined an obscene amount of cash. </p>

				<p>In all seriousness the fight was a disgusting black mark upon the NBA and commisoner Stern was mortified. </p>
				<p>Several NBA players and coaches said the brawl was the worst fight they had ever seen, and even Pacers fans began to refer to the team as &quot;the Thugs&quot;. In the post-game commentary on ESPN's NBA Shootaround, ESPN studio analysts laid the blame on the Piston fans. John Saunders of ESPN referred to the fans as &quot;a bunch of punks&quot;, and Tim Legler said that &quot;the fans crossed the line.&quot; Stephen A. Smith stated that &quot;some of them (the fans) should be arrested as far as I'm concerned&quot;. Their commentary prompted ESPN vice president Mark Shapiro to place calls to host Saunders, as well as analysts Legler, Smith, and Greg Anthony. Shapiro felt their commentary was biased. The following Tuesday, Shapiro stated, &quot;I wish the studio hadn't laid the blame solely on the backs of the fans Friday night.&quot;<br>
					Although a significant portion of media criticism was directed at the Pistons fans, only 46% of the voters in the ESPN SportsNation poll believed that the fans were to blame for the incident.[ Other commentators said that Artest and the other players involved were to blame.</p>
