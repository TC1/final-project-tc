				<h1>Dr. J vs. Larry Legend </h1>
				<h2>November 9, 1984 </h2>
				<p>This little number occured early on in the season when the Sixers, led by the good doctor were taking on Larry and the Celtics in Boston. Larry was having a much much better game than Julius and he didn't like that at all, not one little bit. This was the 80's, where hard fouls and rough play were more accepted, even encouraged. Just look at the little minute things players get called for today.  </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/lebron-james.jpg" width="300" height="300"> &quot;He called me a doodyhead!!&quot; Or something to that effect. I don't know. Lebron is a baby is the point here. </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>In any case, Dr. J was real sick of Larry draining 3's in his face and generally just acting superior and smug. So towards the end of the third quarter with around a minute and a half to play on the clock, the good Dr. decide to examine Bird free of charge. He did this by latching on to Larry's throat like it was a loose ball. Bird, not wanting his streak of three's to end, and wishing to live responded in the manner most appropriate, by choking out Dr. J. </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/larry-bird.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Fun Fact: A few months later they did a sneaker commercial together, and hated every second of it.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Unfortunatley for Larry, Julius had backup in the form of Charles Barkley and Karl Malone, aka The Round Mound of Rebound and the Mailman respictively. They were only too happy to pin down Larry's arms, entititling J to a bunch of body shots. </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/download.jpg" width="256" height="192">This happens to me every single birthday. And sometimes other days too. *sigh*</p>
				<p>Eventually, the fight was broken up and the Celtics ended up winning bigtime. But every Sixers, fan to this day consider it a Philly win because of what happened to Bird.</p>
