				<h1>McHale vs. Rambis </h1>
				<h2>1984 NBA Finals </h2>
				<p>The Lakers and Celtics were the NBA throughout the 80s. These teams were lifelong rivals and it was only magnified by the rivalry that Magic Johnson had with Larry Bird. The finals were sure to be an exciting series. Especially with such great roleplayers like Kurt Rambis, aka The Original Superman. Just look at the guy. Why do you think he wears those glasses?</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>For the Celtics you had Kevin McHale coming at 6 foot 10 inches of pure basketball. </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/mchale.jpg" width="300" height="300"> BEASTMODE. </p>
				<p>Game 3 in the finals saw Magic and the Lakers running circles round Boston with the Celtics getting more and more frustrated with each passing minute. Rambis got a breakwaway layup and it looked like another easy basket. Not if McHale had anything to say about it. </p>
				<h1><img src="basketball images/kurt-rambis-clotheslined.jpg" width="500" height="350">WHAM </h1>
				<p>Dear God. Rambis was immediatly brought to the floor.....Where he immediatly charged at McHale. They don't call him Superman for nothing. Celtics however went on to win the series and take home the gold. Oh, adn nobody, I repeat NOBODY was fined or suspended for that incident. The 80s were awesome!</p>
