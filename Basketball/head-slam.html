				<h1>WARD vs BROWN </h1>
				<h2> Game 5 Eastern Conference SemiFinals 1997</h2>
				<p>The New York Knicks and the Miami Heat were in a grueling contest to claim top spot in the East. The series was a testament to both teams ability. The Knicks probably would have won too, had it not been for this fellow. </p>

				<p>Heat forward PJ Brown gave a hard foul to Knicks point guard Charlie Ward while scrambling after a missed foul shot.</p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/charlie-ward.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Seen here, not in pain and agony.</p>
				<p>Charlie Ward took boxing out seriously. He damn near took P.J. Brown's legs from under him which made P.J. angry beyond belief. Brown was so annoyed that he flipped Charlie with one arm like he was a little kid. Unfortunatley, for you, the NBA removed as many pictures of subsequent slam to the ground and benches clearing brawl off online as humanly possible.</p>
				<p>Also, unfortunatlry for the Knicks, Allan Houston, Patrick Ewing, and Charlie Ward were suspended for Game 6, while Larry Johnson and John Starks were out for Game 7. P.J. was out for both. The Heat ended up winning the series, overcoming a 3-1 deficit with the aid of the Knicks' suspensions. This is the stuffÂ  real rivalries are made of. Or bullshit, depeding on what fan you ask.</p>
