				<h1>HOOPS </h1>
				<p>Way back in 1891 a bunch of gym students at the Springfield (Massachusetts) College YMCA were bored with having to do gymnastics and calesthenics all winter long. Faculty tasked profressor James Naismith to develop a new game that was &quot;Fair for all players and not too rough.&quot; Naismith sketched out some rules, nailed two peach baskets at opposite ends of the floor and dubbed the game Basketball. It was a huge success and Naismith went on to becoming one of the earliest top coaches of the game and lived to see Basketball become a part of the Olympics (1936) and the NCAA DI Tournament and Championship (1939) </p>
				<p>Naturally the game has come a a long way from peach baskets and &quot;not too rough.&quot; Granted while today the refs like to call the slightest tap a foul, there have been occasions when things tend to get a little out of control and all hell breaks loose. Here are just a few of those special occasions.</p>
