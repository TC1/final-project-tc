				<h1>BYNUM BLASTS BAREA 
				</h1>
				<h2>GAME 4 Western Conference Finals 2011 </h2>
				<p>This happy fellow is J.J. Barea. Point guard for the Dallas Mavericks, (at the time of the incident). He tops in at an even 6 foot. </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/barea.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Here he is, conversing politley with the officials. </p>
				<p>This maniac is Andrew Bynum. He was the center for the Lakers at the time and tops in at an even 7 foot, a full 12 inches taller than Barea. </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/bynum.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Here he is, threateneing a small child. ( sources needed) </p>
				<p>In any case, the two clashed during Game 4 of The Western Conference Finals in a game that Dallas was running away with. Similar to poor old Kurt Rambis decades before, Barea had a breakaway layup that should have been an easy 2 points. </p>
				<p><img src="basketball images/bynum-foul.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Excuse me sir, I believe that's my ball. </p>
				<p>Bynum elbowed Barea with every fiber of his frame and Barea crumpled to the ground in agony. Bynum, realizing that he acted like a total jerk, immediatly was escorted willingly off the court under boos and jeers. He was suspended for the first 5 games of the next season as well as a hefty $25,000 dollar fine. </p>
