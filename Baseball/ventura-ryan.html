				<h1>VENTURA vs RYAN </h1>
				<h1>August 4, 1993 </h1>
				<p>Nolan Ryan, the Hall of Famer known for his high-90s fastball, would plunk White Sox third baseman Robin Ventura on Aug. 4, 1993.</p>
				<p><img src="baseball images/ventura.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
				<p>Ventura thought about taking his base, but something snapped about ten feet up the line that triggered his attack on the 46-year-old Ryan.</p>
				<p><img src="baseball images/nolan-ryan.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Seen here, loking rather good for a man of his age. </p>
				<p>A bench-clearing brawl ensued and Ryan was able to put Ventura in a headlockâ€”pounding his head with a few crushing blows. However, Ventura would not quit</p>
				<p>.<img src="baseball images/punch-out-ryan.jpg" width="300" height="300"> Though he probably should have considering he was getting the snot kicked out of him.</p>
				<p>He was able to take down Ryan and avoid any major injury.</p>
				<p>Ryan pitched well and the Rangers were able to take the game, 5-2.</p>
