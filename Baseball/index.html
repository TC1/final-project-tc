				<h1>America's Pastime </h1>
				<p>Is there anything more American than baseball? Besides Mom's apple pie and shooting terrorists that is. Baseball has its origins stretching all the way back to 1791. Throughout the mid 19th century a baseball craze hit teh nation and soon everyone wanted to play. Today, Little League is the largest youth sport organization in the world meaning even kids can get a part of the action, or sit in right field and pick daisies or count bugs, as I did when I played back in the day. </p>
				<p>My baseball career (if you could call it that) was brought to an end by an erratic pitcher with a penchant for launching fastballs into people's faces. I was one such victim. I didn't sustain any injuries that would inhibit me from playing, rather I just became a total baby and quit after the season was over. Thinking back, maybe I should have charged the mound, much like these fine fellows did.</p>
