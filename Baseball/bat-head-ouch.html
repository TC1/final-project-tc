				<h1>MARCHIAL vs. ROSEBORO </h1>
				<h2>August 22, 1965 </h2>
				<p>On August 22, 1965, Giants Hall of Famer Juan Marichal used more than just his fist in a fight against the Dodgers&rsquo; John Roseboro.</p>
				<p>In the midst of a pennant race between the teams, Sandy Koufax was on the mound in a marquee pitching matchup. Roseboro, the Dodgers&rsquo; catcher, routinely threw the ball back to Koufax in the third inning. Unfortunately, Marichal—who was batting at the time—thought Roseboro was intentionally trying to hit him in the head on the throw back.</p>
				<p>A brawl between Roseboro and Marichal ensued and, instead of a fists, Marichal chose to utilize his bat. After a few blows to the head of Roseboro, Koufax and his teammates were able to pry Marichal away from Roseboro, but not after the Dodgers' catcher was dripping in blood.</p>
				<p><img src="baseball images/Marichal-Roseboro-Leifer-1.jpg" width="640" height="465">Marchial was wating for the thumbs up or thumbs down signal from the emperor in the skybox. Also, why does the umpire look so remarkably calm?</p>
				<p>This was certainly one of the more surprising, nasty and disturbing fights recorded in MLB history.</p>
