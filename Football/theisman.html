				<h4>JOE THEISMAN DEAR GOD. </h4>
				<h1>LAWRENCE TAYLOR vs. JOE THEISMAN </h1>
				<h2>1985 </h2>
				<p>I won't show this particular image because of its gruesome nature. This one was rough, even for me.</p>
				<p>nyone and everyone who is a football fan knows about this cringing play. It was a night back in 1985 when the 5-5 Washington Redskins where facing the 7-3 New York Giants.</p>
				<p>The Redskins were coming off of a loss to the Dallas Cowboys but it seemed QB Joe Theismann had a hot hand as he completed seven of his first 10 passes.</p>
				<p>It was the second quarter however that unfortunately sealed Theismanns' NFL fate. On a play that was called by Joe Gibbs, Theismann handed to ball of to then RB John Riggins who was plowing towards the line.</p>
				<p>Riggins flea-flickered the ball back to Theismann and the rest is historyâ€”LB Lawrence Taylor latched on from the back and relentlessly dragged Joe to the ground, breaking his leg in the process!</p>
				<p>Theismann takes the cake! </p>
